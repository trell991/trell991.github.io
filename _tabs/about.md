I'm Tai, an aspiring DevOps engineer based in Chicago with a background in cloud consulting and IT operations. I began my career as a Cloud Engineer, where I built and deployed custom cloud-based integrations on the Azure platform.

Over time, I’ve gained hands-on experience building managing and automating infrastructure. Whether it’s setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing resources with Infrastructure as Code, or streamlining deployments, I enjoy building systems that are scalable, reliable, and easy to manage.

Continuous learning is is the name of the game so im currently expanding my skills in containerization, monitoring, and cloud-native architectures.
