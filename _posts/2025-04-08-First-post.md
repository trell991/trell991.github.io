Hello, and welcome to the lab! Here, I’ll be documenting all of my personal projects, ideas, and aspirations—not only to serve as a portfolio of my work as an engineer, but also to leave a paper trail of my journey in the tech industry.

Currently, I’m in an IT Operations role and looking to transition into a specialized DevOps role. While in school at the Illinois Institute of Technology, my professor—Professor Jeremy (my favorite professor)—introduced me to the DevOps discipline and its practices. An enterprise server tower was donated to the school, and Professor Jeremy turned it into our department’s internal cloud platform by running Proxmox on it.

During an independent study with Professor Jeremy, he introduced me to tools like Packer, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, and more. We built golden images using Packer via the Proxmox plugin and deployed instances of those images to our internal cloud platform. Later, I took a capstone course where, as a group project, we architected an application from scratch and deployed it—following DevOps principles—to the internal platform. After deployment, we continued to add features and included testing in our pipelines. This experience gave me my first real taste of the software development lifecycle. Looking back, that class gave me a ton of confidence before entering the industry as an engineer. I had no idea how to architect an application from scratch or deploy it to the cloud, so I had to figure things out along the way.

After completing both the independent study and the capstone course, I was hooked. I knew that pursuing a career in DevOps was exactly what I wanted to do. I have a long career ahead of me, and I’m excited to see how it all plays out. On this blog, I’m hoping to capture the ups and downs of my career in tech and share a perspective of the industry through my own lens.

I have a ton of ideas to share here, so stay tuned for project overviews, useful code snippets, rants, and maybe even some demo videos of projects I’ve built.
