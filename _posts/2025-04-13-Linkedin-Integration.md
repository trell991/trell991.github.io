## What I Want to Build

I'm currently hosting this blog on GitHub Pages, and it's built on top of Jekyll.
I'd like to add functionality to automatically cross-post to LinkedIn. So, any time I publish a new blog post here, it will also get posted to LinkedIn. I imagine this should be a simple integration—but we’ll see. I’m sure LinkedIn has an API or library I can use to make this happen, so keep an eye out for the next post for this project.

## Features

Once the basic integration is done, I’d like to add a few features. The first that comes to mind is selective cross-posting. By that, I mean I only want certain posts on my blog to be shared to LinkedIn—not all of them.

I'm thinking to limit it based on category. For example, if a post is categorized as "Projects," it will be cross-posted to LinkedIn. But a post in the "Rants" category will stay on the blog only.

Right now, I’m mainly focused on just getting the integration working. But once I come up with more feature ideas, I’ll be sure to add them here. Once the integration is complete ill be sure to share the code.

Cheers!
